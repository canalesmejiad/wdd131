            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath
                commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and
                ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh
                a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble,
                patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him,
                even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>
